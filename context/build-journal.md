# Build Journal

> **Role:** Full archive of build decisions, gotchas, and verification results, organized by feature.
> **Write to after every completed feature.** When `progress-tracker.md` "Key Decisions" exceeds ~10 bullets, prune the older/lower-stakes ones here.
> **Relates to:** mirrors the feature order in `build-plan.md`.

## Phase 0 · Feature 01 — Project scaffold & tooling  *(2026-06-22)*

**Decisions:**
- **Scaffold depth = package skeleton only.** Created `app/` + every subpackage dir
  with just `__init__.py` (each carrying a one-line boundary docstring); **no** module
  files — each later feature creates the modules it owns. Honors "build only what the
  feature requires."
- **Python pinned to 3.12** via `.python-version` (local system Python is 3.14.5).
  `uv sync` auto-fetched CPython **3.12.13**. Matches the documented 3.12+ target and
  avoids bleeding-edge wheel gaps for C-extension deps (selectolax, playwright) on 3.14.
- **One smoke test** (`tests/test_smoke.py::test_app_package_imports`) — pytest exits
  with **code 5 ("no tests collected")** on zero tests, which would fail CI; one real
  test makes pytest exit 0.
- **Build backend = hatchling**, `packages = ["app"]`, so `uv sync` installs `app`
  editable → `import app` and `uvicorn app.main:app` resolve in the venv and CI
  (flat layout, no `src/`).
- **Dependency layout:** runtime deps in `[project.dependencies]`; `ruff` / `pytest` /
  `pytest-asyncio` in `[dependency-groups] dev`. Minimal floors only (`pydantic>=2`);
  the committed `uv.lock` is the exact-pin source of truth.
- **Tooling config:** ruff `target-version = "py312"`, `lint.select = ["E","F","I","UP","B"]`;
  pytest `asyncio_mode = "auto"`, `testpaths = ["tests"]`.
- **CI:** single GitHub Actions workflow on push + PR — `uv sync --frozen` → `ruff check`
  → `ruff format --check` → `pytest`; `astral-sh/setup-uv@v5` reads `.python-version`.
  **No** Playwright Chromium install yet (deferred to Feature 06 — first render tests).
- **`.gitignore` and README were already complete** from prior commits — not regenerated.
- **`MAX_CONTENT_CHARS=50000`** chosen as a provisional `.env.example` default (the
  code-standards table gives no number); Feature 02 finalizes the authoritative
  `Settings` default.

**Gotchas:**
- pytest exit-code **5** on an empty suite would fail CI — fixed by the smoke test.
- First sync must be plain `uv sync` (generates `uv.lock`); CI uses `uv sync --frozen`
  for reproducibility — verified consistent ("Checked 60 packages", no drift).
- Notable resolved pins (in `uv.lock`): ruff 0.15.18, pytest 9.1.1, pytest-asyncio
  1.4.0, pydantic 2.13.4, pydantic-settings 2.14.2, playwright 1.60.0, starlette 1.3.1,
  uvicorn 0.49.0, anthropic, openai 2.43.0, selectolax 0.4.10, jsonschema 4.26.0.

**Verified:**
- `uv run python --version` → 3.12.13; `uv.lock` generated; `import app` OK.
- `ruff check .` → All checks passed; `ruff format --check .` → 11 files already formatted.
- `pytest` → **1 passed**, exit 0.
- `uv sync --frozen` → consistent (no lockfile drift).
- `.env.example` covers all 26 documented vars; defaults satisfy the future invariant
  `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS (4) <= MAX_QUEUED_JOBS (50) <= MAX_JOBS (500)`.
- CI workflow is valid YAML with the four gates; green run to be confirmed after the
  first push (commit/push only on request).

## Archived spec decisions  *(pruned from progress-tracker.md "Key Decisions", 2026-06-22)*

_Pre-code decisions from the 2026-06-21 context review, moved here to keep the tracker's
Key Decisions near ~10. The authoritative versions live in `architecture.md` /
`library-docs.md`._

- **Render uses `domcontentloaded` + bounded settle**, never `networkidle` (which can
  hang on long-polling/analytics pages).
- **HTMX polling stops via HTTP `286`** when all jobs are terminal/empty, and **restarts**
  because the submit response re-arms the `every 2s` trigger; the dashboard submit uses a
  form-encoded handler, not the JSON API route.
- **Provider errors are generic & user-safe** (full detail logged, never interpolated into
  `ProviderError`); `MAX_CONTENT_CHARS` is a lossy char cap (chunking is a Phase-5 follow-up).
